## Installation

1. First of all you need to change your TF2 language to English
2. Pick Demoman
3. Choose "Bottle" as melee weapon in Demoman loadout
4. Pick melee weapon
5. Run the script, press bind (by default its "j") and enjoy!
## Configuring

Find settings.json in the folder of the script and open it as text file.

It's will look like this

```json
{
    "activation_button": "j",
    "button_for_second_voicelines": "x"
}
```

The activation button speaks for itself. Don't like executing N-Word using "j"? Don't worry, just change it to almost any other button or combination!

Even "win+n" will work (Don't forget to disable default bind for inventory using "n", otherwise this combo will not work (lol))

#

In TF2 second voiceline menu by default is binded to "x", so you probably no need to change that.
